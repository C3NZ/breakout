# Breakout MDN
Recreating Mozillas game of Breakout 

## Dependencies
* Node (Runtime for running the web server)
* express (Web framework)

### What I learned
During the development of this app I learned to write more elegant javascript
programs utilizing OOP principles. Mozilla provided a version of this game 
that didn't utilize es6 classes. By following the tutorial and doing some research
about classes in javascript, I was able to recreate the game in what I think to
be a more module way.
